1. For all many-1 relationships, we have the FK on the "many" sides. For example, each itinerary is associated with only one user and one hotel (since an itinerary takes place on one city, we assume that the user will live on the same hotel for the whole itinerary, and that's why hotel differs from restaurant and attractions). To clarify futher, when we say "Iternary - 'books at' - Hotels (Many to 1), it means	a single Hotel can be referenced by many Itineraries and each Itinerary references exactly one Hotel.
   
2. Our UML tells that an itinerary will be based on exactly one hotel, and we assume that user will change to a different hotel in the same city. However, a user can try different restaurants in the same city. For functional dependencies, we have: ItineraryID â†’ Start_Date, End_Date, Destination, UserID, Hotel_Id. Each itineraryID determines exactly one start_date, end_date, destination, UserID, and Hotel_Id. Similarly, for AttractionEvent and RestaurantEvent, each eventID can determine all other attributes.
