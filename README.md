# Project Title: Pathway: Travel Smart

# Summary

Our project helps excited travelers plan their trip efficiently by guiding them towards creating their own personalized itineraries. They can input their travel preferences and details about their personality, and location of travel (within the USA). Then, our application first helps users acquire a place to stay using the user-demographic information they input. For example, if a user likes the ocean, our application will recommend a hotel by the ocean or a body of water if it exists. After selecting their hotel, the traveler can then map out every day of their trip, selecting different attractions for each day. Based on different things the traveler likes, our application will recommend different attractions aligned with their interests.

The project will also have features that will help users feel good about thier selected attractions. Pathway will summarize reviews about different attractions they may choose and guide them towards choosing the best attraction for thier needs. Moreover, the built in total cost estimation will allow users to optimize their budgets to create an iternitary that is budget-friendly, structured, and engaging! In the end, users will be able to narrow down the vast amounts of attractions and accomodations offered to a select few that match their preferences. To tackle these vast amount of options, Pathway provides a streamlined, enjoyable, and user-friendly experience that makes the overwhelming process of trip-planning fun!

# Description

**Pathway** is a trip-planning application designed to help travelers efficiently create personalized itineraries within the USA. It will allow them to input their travel preferences, interests, hobbies, personality traits, and budget, which we will then use to give the user the appropriate attractions, accommodations, and dining experiences. Oftentimes, many travelers struggle with poor trip management, which leads them to miss key attractions, exceed their budget, or overload their schedule. There are just so many options available, and it is inconvenient for travelers to look through endless reviews and recommendations to find the best options. 

Pathway helps solve this problem using data to streamline the planning process, which will ensure that users receive well-balanced and self-fulfilling itineraries. We will first help users receive tailored hotel recommendations based on their preferences. Once they decide on where they will live for the duration of their trip, they will then be able to get access to different attractions and sites to visit. The itinerary will first start off with the first day of the trip, and the user can allocate the appropriate time for each attraction and move onto the next day. For these attractions, users can also apply an appropriate filter for things like accessibility, family-friendliness, dietary restrictions, etc., to ensure that the recommendations align with their needs. In the end, we want to help travelers tackle the abundance of choices in going on a trip by providing a structured and data-driven approach to trip planning.

# Creative Component

Our application can include multiple useful creative components such as an interactive itinerary visualization, which will make the process of creating and updating a userâ€™s itinerary fun and engaging.

## Interactive Itinerary Visualization

Our vision for this creative component is that users can look at a visualization of their itinerary through a visual timeline component, and they can drag and drop activities into their itinerary. This will help users visualize their itinerary and be more engaged with making their itinerary.


# Usefulness

Our trip planner application is highly useful because it addresses the problem of poor trip organizing by allowing users to plan their itinerary based on their preferences, budget, and accessibility needs. Unlike most other travel booking websites that focus on a very specific aspect of travel, ours will combine many aspects of trip planning including hotels, attractions, and restaurants, into one single platform. 

Beyond this, our platform will recommend these aspects of the trip based on what things they like to do and what they prefer on a trip. Users will be able to create personal profiles, where they can put their age, budget, interests, and preferences. We will then use this information along with other information such as proximity to public attractions to recommend an attraction or accommodation that closely matches their needs. These recommendations would help prevent bad trip organizing by making it more convenient and efficient for the user, as they will likely be drawn to our recommendations. This feature also helps the users navigate through the mountain-load of options they might have. Moreover, they can also visualize and modify their itineraries interactively, adding or removing activities with ease.

There are existing platforms such as TripAdvisor and Expedia that assist users in booking hotels and finding attractions, but our application offers a more personalized, interactive, and efficient itinerary planning experience. For example, rather than showing a list of attractions or hotels in a selected area, Pathway will show users attractions or accommodations that most closely match their needs, allowing users to connect all aspects of their trip into a structured plan with ease. This makes Pathway a more convenient and efficient option for travelers, as they can navigate through mountains of options to plan out their best trip yet!
